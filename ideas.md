One thing I'd like to be able to do, is set a value for each organism that is used to train the ai, the value is for the average amount of cells (and atoms etc) in said organisms relative to their size. Hopefully "simulating" cells and whatnot may help the ai with figuring out stuff, and may help us figure out if anything the ai produces is a viable organism

I was also thinking of adding stuff like training it on unfinished sequences too, specifically for animals that we have close relatives or convergent organisms for: basically teaching the ai about how organisms connect and branch off and the overlap etc, and when the sequence gets finished we can add the finished sequence in to teach it how close/far it was

adding already mapped/defined genes/groups-of-genes (as in we know what they do) as external values to help teach the ai
